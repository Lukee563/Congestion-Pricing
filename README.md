This paper explores the effect of New York City’s Lower Manhattan congestion pricing policy on traffic collisions in the district of Manhattan. Using data from the City of New York’s Motor Vehicle Collisions-Crashes database, we will evaluate how the congestion pricing policy implemented on January 5th, 2025, has affected Lower Manhattan’s total weekly collision count over the past 10 weeks. Employing a difference-in-differences approach comparing the congestion relief zone of Lower Manhattan to Upper Manhattan, we find a decrease of 20 total collisions where vehicle damage was greater than $1,000, or a person was injured, per week, representing a 16.66% reduction in the last 10 weeks from the average weekly collision count. This reveals the drastic effect of the congestion pricing policy on vehicle collisions and provides more evidence for the policy's existence.
